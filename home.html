        Demo of Unspoken Words

        <p style ="font-size:20px">
          The concept of Unspoken Words is a visual novel like game in witch you would interact with the character  <br>
          who lacks words to response back. Instead you would see their response based on the background shifting. <br>

  <p style= "margin-left: 20px; font-size: 20px"> <b> Concept</b></p>
  

    <p style ="font-size:20px">
    Unspoken Words's concept started off from what if you tried to speak your mind out,     <br>
    but the words you fail to convey those exact words with emotion and it falls into a mess  <br>
    of a smeared paint combined around. This project serves to define *Unspoken Words* through <br>
    video game medium where you as the audience interacts with the mysterious hooded finger to <br>
    past time around. Depending on the options you pick the hooded finger will react to your <br>
    choice with the background shifting between AI imagery as a symbolism to its lack  <br>
    of words in attempts to express how they feel about your response. <br>

      <p style ="font-size:20px">
      I used Adobe Firefly to be able to have a wide range of different imagery to express each emotion:<br>
      angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad and suprised. I had to control and iterate around the many options<br>
      for how I wanted each emotion to be expressed with a bit of vagueness. Hence why the chosen images<br>
      seem like it could have trailed off from each other for emotions aren't just one layer but multiple <br>
      layers where the human mind can have a mix of emotions between the main emotions expressed. <br>

    <p style= "margin-left: 70px; font-size: 20px"> <b> Where It All Went Down Hill</b></p>
  
<center>
    <p style ="font-size:20px">
    The development procress was all over the place with the coding progress in an attempt to learn JavaScript initally, as<br>
    time spent trying to learn it on my own which intially worked out a random image generator. Diving straight<br>
    into attempting to learn how to code a visual novel with JavaScript was beyond my coding expertise.<br>
    Not even Chat GPT could help guide me through the coding process due to my coding being all over the place. <br>

  <p style= "margin-left: 20px; font-size: 20px"> <b> Outcome</b></p>
  

    <p style ="font-size:20px">
    In order to have at least a demo of what the concept could have been, it was determined that  <br>
    everything must be scrapped and be simplified. I was cramming too much differnt functions  <br>
    to try to get everything to work instead parts were working while others weren't no matter <br>
    how ever much was troubleshooted. Back to P5.js it was, since I onced used it for a different<br>
    project. With some assistant to arrange all the pieces right to work on the demo to work <br>
    and help from Chat GPT to help point out the flaws and implementing the functions for   <br>
    Unspoken Words's concept, finally the demo was created. <br>
